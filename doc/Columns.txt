Columns

By default paragraphs are rendered as a vertical stack of elements (one below another). It is possible however to divide available space into columns.

dd   TDocDefinition

  dd.BeginContent()
   dd.AddText('This paragraph fills full width, as there are no columns. Next paragraph however consists of three columns')

   dd.BeginColumns()

    ! auto-sized columns have their widths based on their content
    dd.AddText('First column', '"width": "auto"')

    ! star-sized columns fill the remaining space
    ! if there's more than one star-column, available width is divided equally
    dd.AddText('Second column', '"width": "*"')

    ! fixed width
    dd.AddText('Third column', '"width": 100')

    ! % width
    dd.AddText('Fourth column', '"width": "20%"')

   ! optional space between columns
   dd.EndColumns('"columnGap": 10')

   dd.AddText('This paragraph goes below all columns and has full width')

  dd.EndContent()


[=== compare with pdfmake:
var docDefinition = {
  content: [
    'This paragraph fills full width, as there are no columns. Next paragraph however consists of three columns',
    {
      columns: [
        {
          // auto-sized columns have their widths based on their content
          width: 'auto',
          text: 'First column'
        },
        {
          // star-sized columns fill the remaining space
          // if there's more than one star-column, available width is divided equally
          width: '*',
          text: 'Second column'
        },
        {
          // fixed width
          width: 100,
          text: 'Third column'
        },
        {
          // % width
          width: '20%',
          text: 'Fourth column'
        }
      ],
      // optional space between columns
      columnGap: 10
    },
    'This paragraph goes below all columns and has full width'
  ]

Column content is not limited to a simple text. It can actually contain any valid pdfmake element. Make sure to look at the COLUMNS example.
