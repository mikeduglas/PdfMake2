Document Metadata

PDF documents can have various metadata associated with them, such as the title, or author of the document. 
You can add that information by adding it to the document definition

dd   TDocDefinition

  dd.AddDocInfo('title', 'awesome Document')
  dd.AddDocInfo('author', 'john doe')
  dd.AddDocInfo('subject', 'subject of document')
  dd.AddDocInfo('keywords', 'keywords for document')

  dd.BeginContent()
  dd.AddText('This is an sample PDF printed with PdfMake2')
  dd.EndContent()

	author: 'john doe',
	subject: 'subject of document',
	keywords: 'keywords for document',
  },

}
